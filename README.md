# Nmap_mass_search
This tool optimizes the use of nmap on a large scale by making the output easily readable and copyable. Also comes with top20 and top200 flags support. 

Download and run the tool using python. Upon execution, the tool will prompt you for a target ip range and a target port. It will then scan all ip's in that range and return the ip's where the port is up without any additional info. Useful for copy-pasting and easy to read.
